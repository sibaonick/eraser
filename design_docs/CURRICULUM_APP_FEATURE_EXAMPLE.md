# Curriculum Forking & Cloning Feature
## Introduction & Overview
This document outlines the design for implementing the functionality that allows users to fork or clone others' curriculums within the Curriculum App. This feature is intended to enhance the collaborative and community aspect of the app by enabling users to build upon the work of others, fostering a culture of sharing and continuous learning.

## Goals
1. **Enhance User Engagement:** Encourage users to interact more with the community by sharing and personalizing curriculums.
2. **Promote Collaborative Learning:** Facilitate a collaborative environment where users can benefit from each other's knowledge and experience.
3. **Increase Content Creation:** Drive the creation of more diverse and high-quality curriculums through communal contributions.
4. **Improve User Retention:** Provide a valuable feature that encourages users to return and continue using the app.
## System Design Overview & Architecture
1. **Describe functionality:** Users will be able to view available curriculums created by others and choose to fork or clone them. Upon forking, a copy of the selected curriculum will be created in the user's account, which they can then modify and personalize.
2. **Project Scope:** This feature will require changes in the UI/UX, API, and database to support the new functionality.
3. **Strategies:**
    - Implement a 'Fork' button on the curriculum display page.
    - Ensure proper permissions and attributions are set for forked curriculums.
    - Allow users to modify and save the cloned curriculum independently of the original.
4. **Diagram: **

**5. System Changes:**

1. **UI/UX:** Introduce a new button for forking and a section in the user dashboard for managing forked curriculums.
2. **API:** Create endpoints to handle the cloning process and manage the relationships between original and forked curriculums.
3. **DB:** Update the database schema to track the lineage of forked curriculums and store user modifications.
## Decisions & Tradeoff Considerations
1. **Reasons behind this design decision:**
    1. **Pros:**
        - Encourages active community participation.
        - Provides a quick way for users to start with a structured learning path.
        - Enhances the app's value proposition through user-generated content.
    2. **Cons:**
        - Potentially increases complexity in managing curriculum versions and attributions.
        - May require additional moderation to ensure the quality of shared curriculums.
    3. **Alternative ideas and tradeoffs:**
        - Considered allowing only certain users to share their curriculums, but decided against it to promote openness.
    4. **Potential problems:**
        - Handling merge conflicts if the original curriculum is updated.
        - Ensuring that all forked content respects the original creator's rights and intentions.
    5. **Dependencies to consider:**
        - User authentication and permissions system.
        - Robust version control for curriculums.
2. **I chose this design over alternatives because:**
    - It balances functionality with simplicity.
    - It leverages existing community behavior and expectations around sharing and personalization.
## Proposed Milestones
If the project is large, it can be broken down into the following milestones:

1. **Milestone 1: Architectural Planning**
    - Finalize the feature's design.
    - Update the system architecture to include new components.
2. **Milestone 2: API and Database Development**
    - Develop the necessary API endpoints.
    - Update the database schema and test data integrity.
3. **Milestone 3: UI Implementation**
    - Implement the fork feature in the user interface.
    - Ensure a seamless user experience for forking and managing curriculums.
