## Important Terminology

| Term                    | Definition                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Design**           | The process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. |
| **Distributed Systems**     | Systems where components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. |
| **Infrastructure**          | The underlying framework or system that supports a system or organization, including hardware, software, and networks. |
| **Distributed (Systems)**   | Refers to systems that are spread out across multiple computers which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. |
| **Bounded Context**         | A central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. It is the focus of a specific business and functional area within the application. |
| **API**                     | Application Programming Interface; a set of rules and tools for building application software and interacting with external systems. |
| **Services**                | Independent functions or processes that are part of a larger system, often in a networked environment. |
| **Architectural Patterns**  | Standardized solutions to common architectural problems in software engineering. |
| **Event Buses**             | A system that handles the transmission of events between different parts of a system or different systems. |
| **Modularity**              | The degree to which a system's components can be separated and recombined, often to enhance maintainability and flexibility. |
| **Agile**                   | A methodology emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability to change. |
| **Requirements**            | Defined needs or conditions that a system or component must satisfy to fulfill its intended purpose. |

## Elements of Good Architecture

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                             |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalable**         | The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources. It can grow and manage more users or transactions without performance degradation. |
| **Available**        | The degree to which a system is operational and accessible when required for use. High availability systems are designed to be available most of the time. |
| **Fault Tolerance**  | The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. It's about ensuring service continuity despite issues. |
| **Resilience**       | The capability of a system to handle and recover from unexpected conditions. A resilient system continues to operate effectively even under adverse conditions. |
| **Loosely Coupled**  | A design approach where components are independent of each other's workflows and changes. This makes the system more flexible and easier to modify or scale. |

## Types of Architectures

| Term                    | Definition                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Evolutionary**            | An approach to architecture that evolves over time in response to changing requirements and understanding of the system. |
| **Reactive**                | Reactive architecture is a design approach for building systems that stay reliable and responsive under various conditions. It ensures systems can handle high loads and recover quickly from failures, providing a smooth and consistent user experience. |
| **Microservices**           | An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. |
| **Monolith**                | A traditional unified model for design where all components of a software are interconnected and interdependent.        |
